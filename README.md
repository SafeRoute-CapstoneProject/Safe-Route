# Dynamic Evacuation Routing and Service Connectivity Platform for Puerto Rico

## Problem Description

During coastal flooding and severe weather events in Puerto Rico, evacuation from affected areas is often delayed or obstructed due to traffic congestion, road closures, flooding, and infrastructure failures. There is no dynamic, data-driven evacuation routing system that integrates real-time conditions to optimize safe evacuation paths. Existing static evacuation plans fail to account for changing conditions such as blocked roads, ongoing repairs, or damaged infrastructure. This gap leaves coastal municipalities and residents vulnerable, especially when access to critical services like hospitals, fuel stations, and emergency shelters is compromised.

## Project Goals

The project aims to design and implement a dynamic evacuation routing and service connectivity platform for Puerto Rico's 44 coastal municipalities. The specific objectives are:
1. Develop algorithms similar to those used in traffic navigation apps (like Waze) to optimize evacuation routes based on real-time traffic flow, congestion, and hazard conditions.
2. Integrate data sources on road closures, flooding, repairs, and infrastructure status to provide adaptive routing.
3. Identify critical service points (e.g., hospitals, fuel stations, emergency shelters) and determine accessibility under various flooding scenarios.
4. Build a machine learning system capable of continuously ingesting new information to update evacuation guidance.
5. Provide decision support tools for emergency managers to model evacuation times and identify safe zones.
